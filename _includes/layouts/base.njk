She has spoken internationally about Node.js, JavaScript, Creative Coding, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, NodeBots, and hardware. She's a previous artist in residence at Pioneer Works where she worked on a series that visualized what modern cybernetic augmentation could look like with todays hardware and special effects makeup.
